# linum-m2m : LINUM's Meso to Macro Toolkit
A collection of tools to work with both mesoscale brain data (e.g. the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas) and with macroscale brain data (e.g. diffusion MRI acquisitions). These tools were first developed by Mahdi Abou-Hamdan during his 2022 summer internship in both the [LINUM](https://linum.info.uqam.ca) lab at [UQAM](https://uqam.ca/) (Canada) and the [GIN-IMN](https://www.gin.cnrs.fr/fr/) at [Université Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/) (France).

Please refer to https://m2m.readthedocs.io/ for the installation & usage instructions and the API documentation.
